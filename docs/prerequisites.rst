Prerequisites
=============

A successful execution of pomato requires three components: Folder structure, valid options and 
correctly formatted input data. While there is some flexibility for each of these components, they 
must abide a general structure that is layed out in the next three subsections. 

While it is generally a good idea to have the program dynamically adopt to all possible inputs, but 
because pomato performs a very specific function it simply requires a certain parametrization to work. 
We have opted to be fairly strict when it comes to definition of data structure and input parameters, 
but made sure the definitions are easily accessible to potentially adopt pomato to other applications.

Model Formulation
-----------------

.. math::

   a_t &= 1 &\forall t \in T \\
   b_t &= 1 - 3b \cdot A_{t,z} \quad &\forall t \in T \\

Which is important
